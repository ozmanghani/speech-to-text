# speech-to-text
Whisper CLI Dictation is a lightweight, terminal-based speech-to-text tool for Linux. It lets you speak naturally, transcribes your voice using the powerful Whisper model, and automatically copies the text to your clipboard so you can paste it anywhere—browsers, editors, chat apps, you name it. and keeps everything simple with just your terminal.
